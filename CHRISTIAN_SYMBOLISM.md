## Christian Symbolism in _\`Girls und Panzer'_

#### Ōarai Girls Academy (大洗) [oh-are-rye]

The Ōarai uniform is a white sailor fuku (dress) with green skirt.
The dickey is green with a prominent white Christian cross emblazoned
on it at a prominent height, reminiscent of a crucifix.

White, in Christian tradition, is the color of purity and God's
uncreated light, while green is the color of Pentecost (the receiving
of the Holy Spirit) and the feasts of the Holy Cross.  It is the
color of plants and symbolizes new life and renewal.

The Japanese Kanjii/Chinese characters 大洗 have the literal meaning
of \`Big Wash'.  This is a real place in Japan, a small fishing
village.  Interestingly, \`洗' can also be a reference to \`baptism'.

I think it's interesting that prior to her arrival at Ōarai, Miho,
in many respects, turned her back on her family's brand of _Sensha
Do_ by jumping into a river to save several teammates from a sinking
tank.  This also might be a form of or reference to \`baptism'.
Prior to her arrival at Ōarai, we learn through flashback that
Nishizumi Miho was immersed in the waters of a river.  This also
may be a form of \`baptism'.

In the match vs. _Pravda_ there are a number of interesting elements
of symbolism:

The Ōarai team is cornered in what appears to be an abandoned stone
church.  This may represent the stone tomb in which Christ was laid.

The girls are given a 3 hour ultimatum to surrender.  They spend
virtually the whole 3 hours within the church.  This 3 hours may
be a reference to Christ's 3 days in the tomb prior to his resurrection.

In the final match vs _Kuromorimine_ we see a very strange scene
in which Miho Nishizumi makes quite impossible leaps from tank to
tank across the waters.  Is this a reference to Christ's own walking
across the waters?

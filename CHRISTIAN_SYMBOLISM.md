## Christian Symbolism in _\`Girls und Panzer'_

#### Ooari Girls Academy (大洗) [oh-are-rye]

The Ooari uniform is a white sailor fuku (dress) with green skirt.
The dickey is green with a prominent white Christian cross emblazoned
on it at a height that reminds of necklace.

The Japanese Kanjii/Chinese characters 大洗 have the literal meaning
of \`Big Wash'.  This is a real place in Japan, a small fishing
village.  Interestingly, \`洗' can also be a reference to \`baptism'.

Prior to her arrival at Ooari, we learn through flashback that
Nishizumi Miho was immersed in the waters of a river.  This also
may be a form of \`baptism'.

More on this later as it relates to her rejection of the Nishizumi
school of _Sensha-do_ (Tankery).

Chist's ministry was not centered around his birth town of Bethlehem,
nor the town in which he grew up, Nazareth, nor at the religious
center of Jewish life, Jerusalem, but around Capernaum, a small
fishing village on the Sea of Galilee.  Hence Christ and his disciples
often travel by boat to points along the Galilean Sea.

The girls of Ooari Girls Academy also travel by \`schoolship' for
reasons that are somewhat inexplicable.

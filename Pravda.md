Pravda seems to be a sort of Stalingrad redux for the O'oari Team.
Erwinn-san explictly makes the connection: O'oari team is under-equipped
for an extended campaign in the harsh Russian winter.  Lack of
heaters, provisions, winter gear.  Because of this, and because of
the overall high moral going into the battle, Nishizumi-san changes
battle strategy to pursue an aggressive quick push to disable the
Pravda flag tank.

This aggressive, blitzkreig strategem mirrors the German push into
the Caucuses in the winter of 1941 to attempt to take out the
Russians before the winter closed and they outran their own supply
lines.

The Pravda team engages in a series of \`retreats', drawing
Nishizumi-san into \`Stalingrad', where the trap is closed.
Nishizumi-san is able to withdraw her forces safely into, of all
places, a church.  The Pravda team lays siege on the beleaguered
O'oari tanks.

Interesting reversal here is that the Pravda team sends a negotiater
to request Nishizumi-san's forces and capitulation of the tournament
to which one of Student Council team (possibly \`Odin') respond
\'Nuts!', a reversal of a German-American exchange during the Battle
of the Bulge(?).

With the O'oari teams refusal to surrender, the seige is set with
a time limit of 3 hours.

3 hours may be an allusion to the 3 days Christ lay in the tomb
prior to His resurrection.

Pravda means \`truth' in Russian.  And it is here that the truth
is finally revealed to the Nishizumi-san and the O'oari team.  The
truth is revealed by a one-eyed character.  One-eyedness could
represent weakness of vision or a singular focus of vision.  It
could be an allusion to the Norse god \`Wodin' who also had only a
single eye, is associated with Knowledge, and whom lost his eye in
exchange for Knowledge.  Indeed is Kawashima-san is shown in one
of the Student Council President's old photos as having \`both'
eyes when Nishizumi dines with  Student Council prior to the their
semifinal match.

Interestingly, Momo Kawashima has a furious temper and initially
seems to think that her battle planning/strategy is superior to
Nishizumi-san's.  Hitler too was associated with Odin/Wodin/Wotan,
known for his tirades, and often interfered with his Generals.  Also
interesting, is that one of the operations in the Battle of Moscow,
conducted by Wehrmacht Army Group Centre was Operation Wotan.

Hal 9000, of 2001: A Space Odyssey is another one-eyed character
who breaks down under the burden of the truth....

Outside the Pravda team has layed out their forces with an apparent
\`mistake' designed to lure Nishizumi-san to break out in that
direction.  From within the church, Nishizumi-san correctly identifies
that the distribution of Pravda's forces is a \`lie'.  One of the
lines in the Anglerfish song that the O'oari team sings prior to
breaking out is I something like `I say no, but I really mean yes,
etc.'

Breaking out, not toward the weakest link in the Pravda defence but
toward it's strongest point, throws the Pravda commander and her
forces into con

confusion.  The Pravda commander, her pride wounded, as the battle
failed to play out as she predicted, makes a serious of mistakes
from that point forward.

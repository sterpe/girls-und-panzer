In Real Life, certain Japanese martial arts are considered highly compatible with traditional womanly ideals, including kyuudou and naginatajutsu. In this show, one of those martial arts is sensha-do — the "Way of the Tank", or Tankery for short.

Miho Nishizumi is a sixteen-year-old scion of a legendary Tankery family who, due to a past trauma, has become reluctant to pilot tanks and transferred away from Kuromorimine Women's College, where her family has made a name, into Ōarai Girls' Academy, a little-known school ship docked in a little town of the same name, which has not fielded a Tankery team for the last twenty years. As fate would have it, the Student Council decided to take advantage of the buildup to the upcoming National Tankery Championships to revive their Tankery elective... and push Miho into leading Ōarai's first Tankery class in two decades, whether she likes it or not.

Fortunately, she has new friends who are more than willing to help — boy-chasing Saori Takebe, gentle Hana Isuzu, tank fangirl Yukari Akiyama, and lethargic Mako Reizei. Together with them and a crew of over two dozen girls — including the Student Council, members of the recently-disbanded volleyball team, history buffs, and a group of freshmen — Miho will have to learn to love her sport once more and lead Ōarai to victory — because, as she will eventually learn, there's more at stake than just the school's prestige or her reputation.

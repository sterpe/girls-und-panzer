Here's what I really think this show is about:

The character of Miho Nishizumi represents some sort of pyschic "good" 
spirit or doppelganger who moves _backwards_ through the historical 
defeats of Nazi Germany during the Second World War, somehow redeeming 
them, i.e. the Americans both in France and then Anzio (Italy), Stalingrad, 
before the final confrontation -- the battle in which the redeeming 
doppelganger must confront it's other self, in this case, Miho's virtual 
twin/older sister Maho, who represents the historical reality of Nazi
cruelty and immorality.


The 10th match that ends the nine year streak of Kuromorimine in the 
Tankery Nationals 
The nationals match versus the Russian Pravda team that ends the 
nine year streak of Kuromorimine in the Tankery Nationals is a sort of 
allegorical May 9, 1945 -- the last day of the war between the Germans 
The nationals match that begins the series between Kuromorimine and the 
Russian team Pravda is a metaphor for the capitulation of German 
is a metaphor for the Battle of Berlin.  The termination of the 9-year 
National streak by the Russian team may be a reference to either the 
May 9th, 1945 surrender of German troops to the Russians ending the 
war or the complete encirclement and defeat of the Germany IX Army
during the Battle of Berlin.  In flashbacks of this Battle Miho 
Nishizumi is shown commanding a Tiger #217 which was Otto Carius' 
tank while serving in the 502/511 Heavy Panzer Battalion.  This unit 
surrendered to the Russians on May 9th, 1945 (though Carius' 2nd Company 
of the 502nd surrendered to the Americans on 15 April 1945.

In any event doppelgangers are often associated with death
